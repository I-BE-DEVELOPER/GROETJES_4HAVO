Ariana Grande made her return to the GRAMMYs stage during the 62nd Annual ceremony on Sunday, Jan. 26. With her chill-inducing vocals on prominent display, the powerhouse didn’t miss a beat during her three-song medley.
Grande started off her performance with an orchestra-heavy take on her song "Imagine." After getting back to her Broadway roots with a string-assisted rendition of "The Sound Of Music"'s "My Favorite Things," Grande—clad in a sheer pink teddy—took the audience to a 2020 version of the Von Trapp Family’s bedroom to sing, dance and flex along to the Rodgers and Hammerstein-interpolated "7 Rings."
The petite pop star finished her highly-hyped performance with "Thank U, Next," which is the title track of her GRAMMY-nominated album. The song serves as a classy kiss-off to some of her high-profile romantic relationships.  </H2>

 The singer on Sunday swept the four biggest prizes at the Grammy Awards -- best new artist, record of the year, album of the year and song of the year. She also took home best pop vocal album, for a total of five Grammys.
The wins are history-making.
Eilish is the youngest solo performer to ever win album of the year. The record holder had been Taylor Swift, who won best album at age of 20 for "Fearless." The singer-songwriter abandoned her usual dark, electronic backing to perform “when the party’s over” with her producer brother Finneas on piano. The sibling duo are already both Grammy winners tonight, with Eilish taking home Best Pop Vocal Album for When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? and Finneas besting prolific producers Ricky Reed and Jack Antonoff in Best Producer, Non-Classical, solely for his work on that album. As Eilish performed the ballad, also backed by a choir, it was hard not to notice her outfit glistening. </H3>

Lizzo took the stage at the 2020 Grammy Award to give a performance of “Cuz I Love You” and hit single “Truth Hurts.” She is the night’s most-nominated artist with eight total nods, including Album of the Year.
Sporting a sparkling black gown, Lizzo opened the show by noting that her performance was dedicated to Kobe Bryant, who died early Sunday. She was joined by an orchestra while she belted the soulful track “Cuz I Love You.” On a smaller stage, a ballerina wearing a durag performed during a simple musical interlude before being joined by more dancers.
Lizzo then changed into a bodysuit and joined the dancers for a string-heavy take on “Truth Hurts.” Of course, before the end of the performance her flute floated down to join her; she then accented a flute solo with a “Period!” Before leaving the stage, she added “Welcome to Grammys, bitch!”
Alongside her Album of the Year nomination for her major label debut Cuz I Love You, Lizzo is up for Best New Artist, Song of the Year and Record of the Year. The latter two categories recognized her 2017 single “Truth Hurts,” which found success in 2019 after being featured in the Netflix film Someone Great. Prior to the ceremony, she took home the awards for Best Urban Contemporary Album and Best Traditional R&B Performance for “Jerome.”

<br><br> Lil Nas X is already a two-time winner tonight. He was awarded Best Music Video and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for "Old Town Road (feat. Billy Ray Cyrus)." He could find himself with a win in three of the Big Four categories, including Album of the Year for his EP, 7.

</audio> <br><br>The California native, who performed "NEW MAGIC WAND" and "EARFQUAKE" off of his Best Rap Album-winning (he earned the title later in the show) hit IGOR, quite literally set the stage ablaze with his unparalleled energy. The rapper/producer sported a pink and magenta color blocked suit and his blonde signature bowl cut wig, which moshing doppelgängers also wore throughout the high-octane and colorful performance. 

The stage elevated as the Tyler’s energy rose, and bringing out his IGOR collaborator, R&B legend Charlie Wilson, allowed the performance to experience a magnetic rhythm that never once wavered. Wilson delighted the audience with his iconic vocal riffs.
